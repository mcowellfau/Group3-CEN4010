# Readme Information For Milestone 3

Vertical prototype is now online, and hosted at https://mcowellfau.github.io/Group3-CEN4010/. The following features/functionalities have been deployed: Login/Logout; Store New Member Profile/Retrieve New Member Profile; Sign-up; API calls for food; API calls for exercise; EXP Bar: display, deficit (negative cals = gold color), excess (red color).

All other planned implementation remains consistent with M1 and M2, but the M3 Documentation, available under Documentation\M3, details our planned changes and database structuring, as well as our high-level functional requirements and overview. A detailed risk analysis with exhibits has also been provided.
