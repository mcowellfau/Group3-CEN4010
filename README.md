# Readme Information For Milestone 2

Most of the representations and information from Milestone 1's documentation are consistent
with the current wireframes attached here. We have, however, elected to make the following
changes for the purposes of usability, functionality, and overall implementation:

First, we have elected to allow Users to sign-up for an account or sign-in to an existing
account with Google or facebook accounts. This may change, insofar as we may add other social
media sources to allow for easier sign-ups/logins.

Second, we have consolidated the User's home page and profile page into two separate pages. The
home page represents the User's daily summary, displays their current calorie count via our "EXP"
bar, shows an image of the last food consumed and last exercise completed as pulled from the
Nutritionix API's database, and also displays all recent foods consumed with their calorie counts. This
is essentially a summary of the User's overall progress for the day. The profile page specifically 
contains the User's Username, age, sex, location, and the date at which they joined. They may add a
profile picture, and edit their profile; this is in addition to our extant non-functional requirements
and enhances the User's experience. Their EXP bar is also displayed there, for their reference, as well
as their current "Level," indicating their adherence to the program and how well they have been doing
at the "game" that is our goal-counting calories and maintaining a healthier lifestyle through consistency, exercise, and dieting.

Third, we have modified the About Us page to also contain User Testimonals, from other Users that may
wish to leave reviews. Besides the Additional Resources we discussed, we felt this addition would make
our website a more welcoming space. About Us will also contain some information about the developers
and their goals.

Fourth, we have streamlined the exercise functionality. Simply, the User will search for their
exercise, and it shall be logged and reduce their EXP bar accordingly. It will not require anything
more than confirmation via a modal, which we plan to add. We will also add undo/remove functionality
on the final product.

All other information is consistent with our Milestone 1 Documentation. All of the Milestone 1
Documentation has been updated accordingly to any added features. Modified features are reflected
here.
