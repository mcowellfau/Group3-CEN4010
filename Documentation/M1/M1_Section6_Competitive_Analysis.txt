6. Competitive Analysis

The analysis of competitors’ web sites will focus on five main features (homepage, design, navigation, search, content, usability) and one additional features (retention). The competitive analysis will utilize a numerical scale (1=bad, 2=poor, 3=fair, 4=good, 5=outstanding) and consists of three websites chosen for their focus on food and activity tracking.

MyFitnessPal () https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ 
1. Homepage:
The myfitnesspal homepage is rudimentary in principle. The main homepage features a section called “Your Daily Summary”. In this section, users have access to the number of calories they are allotted per day. This daily caloric allotment is calculated from the weight and height a user inputs upon registration with the site. Users may then update their summary with any foods they’ve consumed or exercise they’ve completed throughout the day. A progress bar denotes the number of calories consumed thus far and fills up based on the calories contained in each food item consumed. Similarly, calories burned from exercise are subtracted from the total calories consumed. A news feed located below the summary makes up the rest of the homepage. Here, users may share their status with other members of myfitnesspal similar to that of a blogpost. 
2. Design:
myfitnesspal approaches the design of their website with simplicity. Text on the page is designed one of two ways: white on a solid blue background or blue on a solid white background. This contrast heightens the discernibility of different aspects of the site making them easy to navigate to. In addition, primary features of the site are capitalized, increasing their visibility and highlighted when the user hovers their mouse over them. Each primary feature of the site (e.g., “MY HOME”, “FOOD”, “EXERCISE”, etc.) has several related subsections. These subsections attempt to break-down the primary features into smaller, more specialized chunks. For example, the “FOOD” feature is broken down into “Food Diary”, “Database”, “My Foods”, “My Meals”, “Recipes”, and “Settings”; “Food Diary” tracks all food eaten during the day and provides a comprehensive breakdown of the nutrition derived from the food item. 
3. Navigation:
Navigation across the site is very good and perhaps the best aspect of myfitnesspal. At the top of the page is the main navigation bar. The navigation bar is central to the page and often the first thing the user sees, making it easy to locate any area of the site they’d like to visit. This bar includes links to all core services provided by myfitnesspal including links to the user’s homepage, food, exercise, reports, apps, community, blog, and any premium features offered by the site. Within each core service (e.g., “FOOD”) lies a separate, smaller navigation bar. This bar contains links to all subsections within a core service (e.g., “Food Diary”). The primary navigation bar remains on the page at all times if the user chooses to go back to a different core service. However, they must select a different core service to view that service’s associated subsections. 
4. Search:
myfitnesspal has several different types of search functions on their website. The first has to do with locating different foods. It is found under the database section within the food core service. In the database section, a user may type into a text-box and search for a wide-range of foods and food products. myfitnesspal attempts to best match the type of food to the text the user has searched. This search function appears to be fairly accurate. For example, if a user types in the word “burger”, the search results in many different foods with the most similar at the top of the list. Unfortunately, this function does not include pictures of the food; this may make it harder on users unable to read-text to identify foods they have consumed. There is also no distinction between meals cooked by a user and those purchased at an establishment like a restaurant. A separate checkbox allowing a user to distinguish between the two may be advantageous in narrowing down search results. Once a user has added a food or meal to their daily intake of calories, that meal is saved to a list and may be looked up again under “My Foods” and “My Meals” from a smaller subset of items. This makes identifying routinely eaten meals much faster and easier on the user. Similar to the food database, myfitnesspal has an exercise database wherein users may search exercises they have completed to add to their daily summary. This search is much more robust and allows users to indicate the time they’ve exercised, number of reps/sets completed, weight lifted, and the amount of calories burned. Users also have access to a “My Exercises” list to quickly look up exercises they complete on a routine basis.
5. Useability: 
Users add food to their daily consumption from the food database section of the site. They select which meal they are currently eating (i.e., breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks). From there, they search the food database for the food by name. They may also locate the food from their personalized list of frequently consumed foods and meals. Users may only search and add one food or meal at a time. This may help users more accurately track the nutrition of individual food items but may take up too much of their time in contrast to if they were able to add multiple items instead. Similarly, the tracking and adding of exercise completed to one’s day functions nearly the same. One caveat is that myfitnesspal makes a distinction between cardiovascular exercise and strength training. 
6. Retention:
Retention of users appears to have been kept in mind when developers created myfitnesspal. If a user tracks their calories every day, a counter appears notifying them of their “day streak”. This reminds users of how many consecutive days they’ve used the website to track their nutrition. Reports for metrics related to characteristics of the user’s body (e.g., weight, waist-size), and aspects of their nutrition like their Vitamin A consumption are generated over set periods of time dependent on the user’s activity. In other words, the more users use the site, the more information they have available to reflect on. User’s may also interact with each other through the community tab and or keep others updated on their fitness via user-driven blog posts. These aspects of the site may better hold users accountable for their fitness and discourage any feeling of loneliness. 
MyFoodDiary () https://www.myfooddiary.com/ 
1. Homepage:
MyFoodDiary’s homepage is straight and to the point. Unlike other nutrition trackers, the free version of this site only serves only as a nutrition “checker” rather than a nutrition “tracker”. The central focus of the homepage is a single search bar. This is used to look up food and the food’s associated nutrition facts. Below this search bar is an ad for the premium version of MyFoodDiary and testimonials from users who have lost weight using the site. 
2. Design:        
The design of the site is a little overwhelming. The fact that MyFoodDiary doesn’t have many features accessible in its free version may allow for this oversight. The white text at the top of the page does not stand out that well in contrast to the colorful background image. In addition, the sign-in and join buttons lack uniformity and when placed next to each other look like they don’t belong on the page. The blog area of the site has individual posts displayed in sequential order from top-to-bottom. A small thin line separates each post; however, if not for this line it would be difficult to discern where one post ends and another begins. In addition, a cluttered display of twitter posts made by the MyFoodDiary twitter account is located on the right of the page.
3. Navigation:
A single navigation bar located at the top of the page serves as the primary method for navigating the site. Users may navigate to one of three sections on the website; including, the home, blog, and help sections. Moving between areas on the site is fairly straightforward. One thing MyFoodDiary does well is allowing users to navigate to different restaurants and or brands within the food tracker. Upon doing so, users may view a somewhat comprehensive list of all food items located at a restaurant or shared among a brand. 
4. Search:
The search function is the main feature of MyFoodDiary. Users are able to search from an extensive database filled with many different types of food. They are able to narrow down their search to specific food brands or restaurants. The level of specificity characteristic of MyFoodDiary’s search function is second to none. For example, when searching for a burger patty, a plethora of options appears; some of those even going so far as to display the ratio of lean meat to fat in the type of burger patty. 
5. Useability:
MyFoodDiary’s nutrition checker is very easy to use. You search the food you want to check the nutrition of and a nutrition label is brought up similar to the one seen on foods at a grocery store. A comprehensive breakdown of the nutrition facts is found in this label. Along with this label, a pie chart is generated, displaying the breakdown of fat, protein, and carbs inherent to the food. If the wrong food was selected, a list of similar food items is generated and displayed to the right for the user’s convenience. Alternatively, the user may re-search and re-select the food item of their choice if it is not in this list. 
6. Retention:
There is nothing on MyFoodDiary’s website that encourages retention of user’s. The search function feels more like a tool to use rather than an engaging game. The blog posts are typically written by nutritionists rather than users and offer almost no way for users to interact with each other.
