   2.2 Product Summary:

    Nutriplay......
    //List of all major committed functions
    //describe unique features 
    //URl to Nutriplay

    2.3 Usability test plan

// Select ONE major function (NOT login or registration) to be tested for usability. We
recommend search or upload/post.
Write a usability test plan for this selected function. Please consult class material on
developing usability test plan and questionnaire. This test plan is to contain

        // Test objective
        //Test plan
        //Questionnaire form: 3 Lickert scale questions, in a form easy to be used by
        reviewer (check class slides). 


    2.4 QA Test plan
    //a) Create formal QA test plan (consult QA class material). Basically, it has to contain
        1) Test objectives: max 0.5 pages
        2) Hardware and software setup: max 0.5 page
        3) Feature to be tested: max 0.5 page
        4) Actual test cases: 3 test cases and results of testing them on your system //
        
Suggested format for QA Table columns are: test #; test title; test description; test
input; expected correct output; test results (PASS or FAIL for each tested browser)
        5) Perform the testing as per plan above and record the results in a form above.
        6) Apply the above test on 2 browsers of different type and record it in the above table

    2.5 Code Review
   1) One team member should submit code to other team member(s) for peer review.
   2) Peer review should be performed by other group member(s) (1 review is OK).
   3) Peer review is to be done by e-mail and comments are to be included in the code
   4) Submit listing containing the peer review and commented code and communication related to this in your Milestone 4 document

//Important: It is critical that code reviews are friendly and helpful, intended to help
and education, and not to criticize. It is strongly suggested that you use peer review
in the development of the whole system.

2.6 self check on best practices for security

1) List major assets you are protecting
2) Confirm that you encrypt password in the DB
3) Confirm Input data validation (list what is being validated and what code you 
    used) – we request that you validate search bar input


2.7 Self check: Adherence to original Non functional specs

//Copy all original non-functional specs as in high level application document
published at the very beginning of the class and then for each say DONE if it is done
(which is expected and required); ON TRACK if it is in the process of being done and
you are sure it will be completed on time; or ISSUE meaning you have some
problems and then explain it.
